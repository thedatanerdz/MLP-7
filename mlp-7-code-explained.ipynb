The train DataFrame contains the data with dates before '20150101', while the test DataFrame contains the data with dates after '20141231'. This type of separation is commonly done in machine learning or time series analysis to split the data into a training set and a testing (or validation) set for model development and evaluation.This line uses the replace() method to remove punctuations from the data DataFrame. It replaces any character that is not a letter (denoted by the regular expression pattern [^a-zA-Z]) with a space. The regex=True parameter indicates that the pattern is a regular expression. The inplace=True parameter modifies the data DataFrame in place, without creating a new DataFrame.\n\nThis step is often performed to clean text data by removing non-alphabetic characters, such as punctuation marks or special characters, to prepare the text for further analysis or natural language processing tasks.These lines rename the column names of the data DataFrame for ease of access. It creates a list list1 containing integers from 0 to 24. Then, it creates a new list new_Index by converting each integer in list1 to a string using a list comprehension.\n\nFinally, it assigns the new_Index list as the new column names of the data DataFrame using the columns attribute.\n\nThis step is optional but can be useful when you want to have more meaningful or descriptive column names instead of the default column names.This line displays the first five rows of the data DataFrame using the head() method. It helps to quickly inspect the resulting DataFrame and verify the changes made.\n\nOverall, the code snippet you provided is preprocessing the train DataFrame by selecting specific columns, removing punctuations, and renaming the column names for convenience. The resulting DataFrame is stored in the data variable, and the first five rows are displayed.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Convertng headlines to lower case\nfor index in new_Index:\n    data[index]=data[index].str.lower()\ndata.head(1)","metadata":{},"execution_count":8,"outputs":[{"execution_count":8,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <th>5</th>\n","      <th>6</th>\n","      <th>7</th>\n","      <th>8</th>\n","      <th>9</th>\n","      <th>...</th>\n","      <th>15</th>\n","      <th>16</th>\n","      <th>17</th>\n","      <th>18</th>\n","      <th>19</th>\n","      <th>20</th>\n","      <th>21</th>\n","      <th>22</th>\n","      <th>23</th>\n","      <th>24</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>a  hindrance to operations   extracts from the...</td>\n","      <td>scorecard</td>\n","      <td>hughes  instant hit buoys blues</td>\n","      <td>jack gets his skates on at ice cold alex</td>\n","      <td>chaos as maracana builds up for united</td>\n","      <td>depleted leicester prevail as elliott spoils e...</td>\n","      <td>hungry spurs sense rich pickings</td>\n","      <td>gunners so wide of an easy target</td>\n","      <td>derby raise a glass to strupar s debut double</td>\n","      <td>southgate strikes  leeds pay the penalty</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>flintoff injury piles on woe for england</td>\n","      <td>hunters threaten jospin with new battle of the...</td>\n","      <td>kohl s successor drawn into scandal</td>\n","      <td>the difference between men and women</td>\n","      <td>sara denver  nurse turned solicitor</td>\n","      <td>diana s landmine crusade put tories in a panic</td>\n","      <td>yeltsin s resignation caught opposition flat f...</td>\n","      <td>russian roulette</td>\n","      <td>sold out</td>\n","      <td>recovering a title</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","<p>1 rows Ã— 25 columns</p>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["                                                   0          1  \\\n","0  a  hindrance to operations   extracts from the...  scorecard   \n","\n","                                 2                                         3  \\\n","0  hughes  instant hit buoys blues  jack gets his skates on at ice cold alex   \n","\n","                                        4  \\\n","0  chaos as maracana builds up for united   \n","\n","                                                   5  \\\n","0  depleted leicester prevail as elliott spoils e...   \n","\n","                                  6                                  7  \\\n","0  hungry spurs sense rich pickings  gunners so wide of an easy target   \n","\n","                                               8  \\\n","0  derby raise a glass to strupar s debut double   \n","\n","                                          9         ...          \\\n","0  southgate strikes  leeds pay the penalty         ...           \n","\n","                                         15  \\\n","0  flintoff injury piles on woe for england   \n","\n","                                                  16  \\\n","0  hunters threaten jospin with new battle of the...   \n","\n","                                    17                                    18  \\\n","0  kohl s successor drawn into scandal  the difference between men and women   \n","\n","                                    19  \\\n","0  sara denver  nurse turned solicitor   \n","\n","                                               20  \\\n","0  diana s landmine crusade put tories in a panic   \n","\n","                                                  21                22  \\\n","0  yeltsin s resignation caught opposition flat f...  russian roulette   \n","\n","         23                  24  \n","0  sold out  recovering a title  \n","\n","[1 rows x 25 columns]"]},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The code  converts the headlines in the data DataFrame to lowercase.

It is used for converting a collection of text documents into a matrix of token counts. It preprocesses the text data by tokenizing it into individual words or n-grams, and then counts the occurrences of these tokens in each document. This matrix representation can be used as input for various machine learning algorithms.\n\nBy importing CountVectorizer, you gain access to the functionality provided by this class, such as fitting a vectorizer on a corpus of text data, transforming text into a numerical representation, and extracting vocabulary information. It is commonly used for text classification, sentiment analysis, and other natural language processing tasks.RandomForestClassifier is a class in the sklearn.ensemble module. It is an implementation of the random forest algorithm for classification tasks. Random forests are an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision tree classifiers and aggregates their predictions to make a final classification decision.\n\nBy importing RandomForestClassifier, you can create an instance of this class and utilize its methods for training a random forest classifier on labeled data, making predictions on new data, and evaluating the model's performance. Random forests are known for their ability to handle complex relationships in the data, handle missing values, and reduce overfitting.\n\nOnce these modules are imported, you can use the functionality provided by CountVectorizer and RandomForestClassifier to preprocess text data and train a random forest classifier on that data, respectively.\n\nPlease note that the code snippet you provided only imports these modules, and further code is required to utilize them effectively for specific tasks, such as preparing the data, splitting it into training and testing sets, fitting the classifier, making predictions, and evaluating the model's performance.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"## implement BAG OF WORDS\ncountvector=CountVectorizer(ngram_range=(2,2))\ntraindataset=countvector.fit_transform(headlines)","metadata":{},"execution_count":33,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# implement RandomForest Classifier\nrandomclassifier=RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=200,criterion='entropy')\nrandomclassifier.fit(traindataset,train['Label'])","metadata":{},"execution_count":34,"outputs":[{"execution_count":34,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["RandomForestClassifier(bootstrap=True, class_weight=None, criterion='entropy',\n","            max_depth=None, max_features='auto', max_leaf_nodes=None,\n","            min_impurity_decrease=0.0, min_impurity_split=None,\n","            min_samples_leaf=1, min_samples_split=2,\n","            min_weight_fraction_leaf=0.0, n_estimators=200, n_jobs=None,\n","            oob_score=False, random_state=None, verbose=0,\n","            warm_start=False)"]},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"## Predict for the Test Dataset\ntest_transform= []\nfor row in range(0,len(test.index)):\n    test_transform.append(' '.join(str(x) for x in test.iloc[row,2:27]))\ntest_dataset = countvector.transform(test_transform)\npredictions = randomclassifier.predict(test_dataset)","metadata":{},"execution_count":35,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"## Import library to check accuracy\nfrom sklearn.metrics import classification_report,confusion_matrix,accuracy_score","metadata":{},"execution_count":36,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"matrix=confusion_matrix(test['Label'],predictions)\nprint(matrix)\nscore=accuracy_score(test['Label'],predictions)\nprint(score)\nreport=classification_report(test['Label'],predictions)\nprint(report)","metadata":{},"execution_count":37,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":"[[139  47]\n\n [ 13 179]]\n\n0.8412698412698413\n\n              precision    recall  f1-score   support\n\n\n\n           0       0.91      0.75      0.82       186\n\n           1       0.79      0.93      0.86       192\n\n\n\n   micro avg       0.84      0.84      0.84       378\n\n   macro avg       0.85      0.84      0.84       378\n\nweighted avg       0.85      0.84      0.84       378\n\n\n"}]}]}
