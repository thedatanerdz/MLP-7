The train DataFrame contains the data with dates before '20150101', while the test DataFrame contains the data with dates after '20141231'. This type of separation is commonly done in machine learning or time series analysis to split the data into a training set and a testing (or validation) set for model development and evaluation.This line uses the replace() method to remove punctuations from the data DataFrame. It replaces any character that is not a letter (denoted by the regular expression pattern [^a-zA-Z]) with a space. The regex=True parameter indicates that the pattern is a regular expression. The inplace=True parameter modifies the data DataFrame in place, without creating a new DataFrame.\n\nThis step is often performed to clean text data by removing non-alphabetic characters, such as punctuation marks or special characters, to prepare the text for further analysis or natural language processing tasks.These lines rename the column names of the data DataFrame for ease of access. It creates a list list1 containing integers from 0 to 24. Then, it creates a new list new_Index by converting each integer in list1 to a string using a list comprehension.\n\nFinally, it assigns the new_Index list as the new column names of the data DataFrame using the columns attribute.\n\nThis step is optional but can be useful when you want to have more meaningful or descriptive column names instead of the default column names.This line displays the first five rows of the data DataFrame using the head() method. It helps to quickly inspect the resulting DataFrame and verify the changes made.\n\nOverall, the code snippet you provided is preprocessing the train DataFrame by selecting specific columns, removing punctuations, and renaming the column names for convenience. The resulting DataFrame is stored in the data variable, and the first five rows are displayed.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Convertng headlines to lower case\nfor index in new_Index:\n    data[index]=data[index].str.lower()\ndata.head(1)","metadata":{},"execution_count":8,"outputs":[{"execution_count":8,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <th>5</th>\n","      <th>6</th>\n","      <th>7</th>\n","      <th>8</th>\n","      <th>9</th>\n","      <th>...</th>\n","      <th>15</th>\n","      <th>16</th>\n","      <th>17</th>\n","      <th>18</th>\n","      <th>19</th>\n","      <th>20</th>\n","      <th>21</th>\n","      <th>22</th>\n","      <th>23</th>\n","      <th>24</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>a  hindrance to operations   extracts from the...</td>\n","      <td>scorecard</td>\n","      <td>hughes  instant hit buoys blues</td>\n","      <td>jack gets his skates on at ice cold alex</td>\n","      <td>chaos as maracana builds up for united</td>\n","      <td>depleted leicester prevail as elliott spoils e...</td>\n","      <td>hungry spurs sense rich pickings</td>\n","      <td>gunners so wide of an easy target</td>\n","      <td>derby raise a glass to strupar s debut double</td>\n","      <td>southgate strikes  leeds pay the penalty</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>flintoff injury piles on woe for england</td>\n","      <td>hunters threaten jospin with new battle of the...</td>\n","      <td>kohl s successor drawn into scandal</td>\n","      <td>the difference between men and women</td>\n","      <td>sara denver  nurse turned solicitor</td>\n","      <td>diana s landmine crusade put tories in a panic</td>\n","      <td>yeltsin s resignation caught opposition flat f...</td>\n","      <td>russian roulette</td>\n","      <td>sold out</td>\n","      <td>recovering a title</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","<p>1 rows Ã— 25 columns</p>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["                                                   0          1  \\\n","0  a  hindrance to operations   extracts from the...  scorecard   \n","\n","                                 2                                         3  \\\n","0  hughes  instant hit buoys blues  jack gets his skates on at ice cold alex   \n","\n","                                        4  \\\n","0  chaos as maracana builds up for united   \n","\n","                                                   5  \\\n","0  depleted leicester prevail as elliott spoils e...   \n","\n","                                  6                                  7  \\\n","0  hungry spurs sense rich pickings  gunners so wide of an easy target   \n","\n","                                               8  \\\n","0  derby raise a glass to strupar s debut double   \n","\n","                                          9         ...          \\\n","0  southgate strikes  leeds pay the penalty         ...           \n","\n","                                         15  \\\n","0  flintoff injury piles on woe for england   \n","\n","                                                  16  \\\n","0  hunters threaten jospin with new battle of the...   \n","\n","                                    17                                    18  \\\n","0  kohl s successor drawn into scandal  the difference between men and women   \n","\n","                                    19  \\\n","0  sara denver  nurse turned solicitor   \n","\n","                                               20  \\\n","0  diana s landmine crusade put tories in a panic   \n","\n","                                                  21                22  \\\n","0  yeltsin s resignation caught opposition flat f...  russian roulette   \n","\n","         23                  24  \n","0  sold out  recovering a title  \n","\n","[1 rows x 25 columns]"]},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The code  converts the headlines in the data DataFrame to lowercase.
